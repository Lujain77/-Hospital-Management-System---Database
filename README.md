Hospital Management System  
Hospital management system enables hospitals to be able to manage the data and information to 
ensure the efficient and successful completion of operations and processes.  
Generally, the hospital system helps to provide a better patient experience, to provide a several 
functions and to manage every department of the hospital. 
â€¢ Objective for solving the problem 
We created this system to help to improve the quality and to manage the data of every aspect. Also, 
we will create a hospital system that will have a friendly user interface to make sure that anyone 
can use it and make every process easily. Also, this system will record information related to 
diagnosis given to patients and keep information about different diseases that helps the doctor to 
treat the patients. The main components of our system are the hospital itself, doctors, patients, 
rooms, treatment, time, etc. Every component has a unique ID and details about every function 
and relation in the system that are shown in the ERD diagram. We will apply everything we have 
taken to create an efficient system using database processes.
